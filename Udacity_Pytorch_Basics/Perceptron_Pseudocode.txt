# Perceptron Pseudo Code

==> Start with random weights
    : w1, w2, w3, ...... , wn, b

==> For every misclassified point (x1, x2, x3,....... xn):
    -> if prediction = 0:  ( Positive point in a negative area)
        for i = 1 .... n
            -> Change wi = wi + alpha * xi
        -> Change b to b + alpha
    -> if prediction = 1:  ( Negative  point in a positive area)
        for i = 1 .... n
            -> Change wi = wi - alpha * xi
        -> Change b to b - alpha


    --> If the best fit line tend to rotate in the clockwise 
        direction , if considered a point in that direction
        weights and biases will get added to it.
